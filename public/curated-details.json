Following the same conceptual thread, it was created using a mixture of accessible AI tools: Artbreeder, Prosepainter, Collage by Studio Morphogen, Midjourney, Diffusion, StabilityAI, and Dalle2, as well as handpainting and digitally collaging where needed for cohesion.\n\nAI-Collaborative art is a budding movement, faced with the same criticisms most new art movements experience--namely, that it isn't art at all, requires no effort or skill, and has no artistic or concrete value. This collection challenges that idea by building on breadth of art history in ways that could only happen with the collaboration of AI, taking care to include art movements that were dismissed initially by the broader art world, and by using a combination of only accessible, no-code tools to create the work. Each work is a single page in a new, transformative chapter in the book of Art History.\n\nTaste is the new skill.",

Technically it is an attempt to reimagine and recreate a classical method but refreshing and REINVENTING it using the latest tools in our visual art creation arsenal. Noah's Ark and the story of the great deluge is a metaphor that I have chosen to depict the controversy and challenges I (and a handful of other early adopters) have been facing since I adopted machine learning tools to create my works some years ago. Much like building a colossal ship amidst inland, far from the sea, it was grotesque, meaningless, and futile at first… Many choose to ignore or make fun of it. Until the Deluge became obvious that is… Now people are flocking in hopes to take a place at the ark!",

Transcribed for your viewing, these dreamscapes capture the surreal and ever-shifting nature of our subconscious mind. Imagine a dream where reality appears familiar, yet, upon closer inspection, the details become increasingly nonsensical: the writing on a sign, the face of a companion, all seemingly taking on new and strange forms. These dreams can be most accurately shared through imagery, and working with AI provides the perfect medium to capture and interpret them. Describing a dream is akin to exploring latent space with AI, where every possible scene exists if the right sequence of words is combined to conjure it. The human form may be distorted, fingers may be too many, and faces may be unlike any you've seen before. But that is what makes the experience all the more satisfying, as both the artist and the viewer participate in the creation of this art by giving each symbol a meaning and label, even if it doesn't make sense in the waking world.",

        "description": "Sub-Liminal examines liminal space through the use of AI. A bridge between reality and the dreamworld aids to give us a glimpse of liminal spaces of our dreams. Liminal spaces that may give us glimpses of the surreal, the unnerving, and even serenity depending on the dreamer.  AI is used to transform fantastical descriptions into images that occupy a liminal space between the real and the imaginary. We dream of strange rooms, scenes and dwellings that could not possibly exist. Sub-Liminal gives us snapshots, hopefully satisfying the need to take another glimpse of a past dream. Sub-Liminal interrogates the notion of the liminal in relation to the virtual and the imaginary, and highlights the potential for AI-generated art to push the boundaries of traditional art forms. Exploring liminal space through AI lets us explore and engage with the boundaries between the real and the imaginary and the known and the unknown.",
